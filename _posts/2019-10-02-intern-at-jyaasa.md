Learning is a lifelong process and learning at a right place will boost your knowledge in less time. I was a fresh graduate from Kathmandu Engineering College with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronic and communication; despite being an electronic engineer, I had keen interest in programming so after graduation I began searching for a place where I can learn programming. I looked over the internet, I searched in the magazines, etc.Then, a friend of mine was working in an IT(Information Technology) company called Jyaasa and he suggested me to join their boot camp. That is where the adventure begun.
